# Operation-Chronos
A simple clock written in Electron

### To Install
1. Clone this repo
2. Install all dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Run the app (`npm start`)

### To Build
This app is built using [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate). Since none of the files need to be compiled (such as from less -> css), you will need to comment out some of the build code to avoid an error.

Keep in mind that boilerplate will only compile to your current operating system -- you can't compile to Linux from Windows / etc.

### Credits
